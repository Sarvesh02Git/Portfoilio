                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    Hello! I'm Sarvesh Parmar, a passionate Web Developer and AI Enthusiast with a knack for building
                    innovative and user-friendly digital experiences. My journey in technology began with a fascination
                    for how things work, leading me to explore various programming languages and frameworks.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    I specialize in creating modern, responsive web applications using technologies like Flask for
                    backend development, and a combination of HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap) for the
                    frontend. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and apply them to solve real-world problems.
                <p>
                    I learned Python Language, I use this language to for my backend and I had done many projects with python.
                    Also have short knowledge of Java.
                </p>
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Beyond coding, I'm deeply interested in Artificial Intelligence and its applications, constantly
                    experimenting with machine learning concepts and exploring how AI can enhance web solutions.
                    I believe in clean code, efficient solutions, and a user-centric approach to design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feel free to explore my projects to see some of my work, or connect with me if you have a project
                    in mind or just want to chat about tech!
